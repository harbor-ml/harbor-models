  description: |
    This is the tensorflow research object detection implementation of the Single Shot Detector (SSD) 
    architecture on top of the mobilenet image classification model. It uses cascadung convolutional filters to predict
    both bounding boxes and object classifications for a given image. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection),
    and you can read more about the architecture in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf).
